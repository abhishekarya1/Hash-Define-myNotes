## Intro
Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used to handle large amounts of realtime data.

- extremely **high throughput** but **low on storage** (hence not a replacement of a DB)
- highly **distributed** and therefore extremely **fault-tolerant**

It is used in applications as an async intermediary (events), and for streaming large volumes of data (e.g. analytics).

It is built in Java and Scala so its native to Java environment.

**Usage**: async messaging between services, metrics and logging, commit log (Saga pattern), stream processing (taking action on a series of data in realtime).

## Components
- **Cluster** - group of kafka servers
- **Broker** - a single kafka server (replicated for high-availability)
- **Topic** (aka _Stream_) - logical entity; group of partitions, can be spread across multiple brokers; no ordered storage of messages is guaranteed on this abstraction level
- **Partition** - indexed log (array) and hence ordering is guaranteed among messages received by a particular partition; data is replicated for redundancy
- **Publisher** - writes messages to topics
- **Consumer** and **Consumer Group** - reads and writes messages from topics by taking ownership of specified partitions
- **Zookeeper** - management component; stores cluster metadata, clients information, routes writes exclusively to leader broker and reads to both leader and follower brokers

## Reads and Writes to a Topic

**Writing to a Topic** (producer): Kafka tries to uniformly distribute messages from a producer among all partitions of the destination topic using algorithms like round-robin, hash of a key, or custom partitioner. This is called **Partition Strategy**.

**Reading from a Topic** (consumer): Kafka assigns partition(s) to the consumer from the source topic to read from. It makes sure all consumers are evenly balanced across partitions. Strategy like round-robin, range assignment is often used for this, and it stays so (_sticky_) until rebalancing due to a consumer addition/removal.

{{% notice tip %}}
To summarise: Producers are not restricted to specific partitions â€” they can write to any partition within a topic, dynamically or explicitly. But Consumers are restricted to the partitions assigned to them within a consumer group, they cannot read from partitions assigned to other consumers in the same group.

## Features
**Replication**: it exists at every level. Cluster, Broker, Partitions are configured to be data replicated and have fail-overs in place in a well configured Kafka system.

**Messages** are just bytes of information to Kafka and its agnostic to their meaning. There is a component **Key** (numeric hash) that can be appended to a message which can then be used to manually decide the partition the message goes to using modulo operation i.e. `key_hash % N` where `N` is the number of partitions in the topic the message is destined to. 

**Schema** is another optional metadata put in the message sometimes. It indicates what kind of data the message contains (i.e.String, JSON, or XML etc). This schema metadata can be stored in Kafka Headers or we can dedicate specific topics for specific message types.

**Offset**: for each consumer Kafka tracks messages already processed by it using an integral number called _offset_ and it maintain its current count so that it can resume from that point in the future if processing fails.

**Retention**: there is a temp storage threshold (1GB per partition) or message TTL (7 days) after which they are deleted.

## Both Consumption Modes
Kafka does pub/sub model well, but we can also do prod/con (MQ) using consumer groups.

### Consumer Group
Each partition must be consumed by **only a single consumer in one group** but the inverse isn't true! One consumer is free to consume from multiple partitions.

When we put consumers in separate groups, we are able to consume a Partition from multiple consumers (one-to-many mapping). And when we put all consumers in a single group each Partition can only be consumed from a single consumer (one-to-one mapping).

- acts as prod/con (MQ) - put all consumers in one group; one partition only maps to one consumer then
- acts as pub/sub - put one consumer in one group; one partition can map to multiple consumers then

We can also use a single partition as a directly-mapped FIFO queue! We can route a message to a specific partition based on Key, and then map a specific consumer to that partition manually (in the code for consumer config).

**Avoiding Redundant Message Processing**: a single message in a partition will be consumed multiple times if its consumers happen to be from diff groups, Kafka has no awareness to prevent it as its just a storage. Hence we need to make sure that we designate groups to consumers in a way that doesn't lead to redundant processing.

**Rebalancing**: Kafka ensures that partitions are evenly distributed among consumers in a group. If a consumer joins or leaves the group, Kafka will rebalance all the partitions among the available consumers within the same group.

### Message Queues vs Kafka
Messages are deleted from MQ by MQ system after they are consumed in a prod-con model. The message deletion can be turned off in most MQ platforms but the general idea of MQ is remove-on-consume.

This is not the case in Kafka. A separate numeric _offset_ is maintained by Kafka for each consumer based on which message they are reading and its updated after a successful consumption of a message. The messages themselves are not deleted from the partition when they are consumed and successfully finish processing. They are deleted after a retention period has passed, disk quota limit is reached, or consumer has gone down (rebalancing), so Kafka acts as a **"Distributed Commit Log"** or more recently called a "Distributing Streaming Platform".

## Zookeeper
Zookeper is the coordinator and the manager, it stores the metadata too.

We can run multiple brokers having exact same topic in a leader-follower hierarchy. Zookeeper handles leader election and replica management.

It stores cluster metadata and clients information as well. It runs on a separate server and has fail-over instances running.

It also takes care of routing for read-write operations:
- redirect writes to leader; change is propagated to all followers
- redirect reads from a follower

{{% notice tip %}}
Since Kafka 2.8.0, we don't necessarily need a Zookeeper and a concensus algorithm (RAFT) can be used, its called KRaft (Kafka RAFT).

## Spring Boot Kafka
Spring Boot automatically adds `@EnableKafka` when we add `@SpringBootApplication` annotation. So we needn't add it explicitly.

**Create a Topic**:
```java
// create a topic (optional ofcourse if topic already exists)
@Configuration
public class TopicConfig{

	@Bean
	public NewTopic createTopic(){
		return TopicBuilder.name("foobar")
						   .partitions(3)
						   .build();
	}
}
```
**Producer**:
```java
// producer
@Autowired
KafkaTemplate<String, String> kafkaTemplate;

kafkaTemplate.send(topicName, msg);		// this returns a CompletableFuture ref
```
**Consumer**:
```java
// consumer
@KafkaListener(topics = "foobar", groupId = "fooGroup")
public getMessage(String msg){
	// processing
}
```

### Properties Config and Message Schema
```txt
kafka broker server ip
consumer group (in consumer only)
key-value serializer/deserializer
	- if we send String messages to Kafka, we specify "String" serializer/deserializer in producer/consumer value
	- if we send JSON (or POJO) messages to Kafka, we specify "JSON" serializer/deserializer in producer/consumer value
	- producer/consumer key is always "String" serializer/deserializer
```

How does the consumer know what kind of data a message has? Since Kafka stores messages as just raw bytes, we need to provide serialization/deserialization **schema** info in headers of a message to indicate what kind of data the message has.

In Spring Boot, we can specify this in properties file as follows:

```sh
# Kafka bootstrap servers
spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers=localhost:9092

# Producer configuration (for JSON message)
spring.kafka.producer.key-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
spring.kafka.producer.value-serializer=org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonSerializer

# Consumer configuration (for JSON message)
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=my-group
spring.kafka.consumer.key-deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
spring.kafka.consumer.value-deserializer=org.springframework.kafka.support.serializer.JsonDeserializer

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Producer configuration (for String message)
spring.kafka.producer.key-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer
spring.kafka.producer.value-serializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer

# Consumer configuration (for String message)
spring.kafka.consumer.group-id=my-group
spring.kafka.consumer.key-deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
spring.kafka.consumer.value-deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
```

### Error Handling
For handling errors that happen during the consumption of the messages, we can specify the number of retry attempts to perform before sending them over to the Dead Letter Topic (DLT).

Kafka creates `N-1` retry topics (`foobar-retry-0`, `foobar-retry-1`, etc.) and puts failed messages in them if retry is needed. Since default retry attempts are 3 therefore Kafka creates 2 retry topics for each of our main topic.

```java
@RetryableTopic(attempts = "4")
@KafkaListener(topics = "foobar")

// retry atmost 4 times (default is 3 if we don't have this annotation)

@DltHandler
// define a method here to process failed messages (fetched from Dead Letter Topic)
```

{{% notice note %}}
_Why do we need retry topics? Didn't we only commit offset when a message is successfully consumed by the consumer? If we don't update the offset then we will process the failed message again right?_ That is true, but we have retry topics to ensure **exactly once semantics** otherwise consumer doesn't have any idea how many retries it has already done and it will go in an infinite loop. So the consumer does retries once from every retry topic created. Kind of verbose ðŸ˜….

## Interview Questions
**ISR** (In-Sync Replicas): they are replicas which are up-to-date with leader's data.

**Consumer Lag**: the diff between the latest offset of the partition and the latest offset which the consumer has consumed.

**Offset Updates**: offset is updated and committed only after successful processing of the message by the consumer, otherwise it will lead to message loss if consumer fails (or goes down) and we already update the offset.
