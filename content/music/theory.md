## Note
Distinct and isolatable sound that act as the most basic building block of music. There are primarily 7 notes - A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Plus 5 additional Sharp (`#`), also denoted as Flats (`b`).

**Observations**:
- the piano is divided into repeating notes as **Octaves** (8 notes) and the more rightwards we go, the higher the pitch gets
- E# and B# don't exist

### Steps/Tones
**Half-Step** or **Semi tone**: 1 note higher. Ex - C to C#.

**Whole-Step** or **Whole tone**: 2 note higher. Ex - C to D.

## Scale
Also called **Key**: preferred ordered sequence of notes.

**Major Scale**: start at a major note (called **Tonic**) and all `WWHWWWH` steps are "on scale". DAW trick is to mark all whites from C and shift to any other note whose major scale we want.

**Minor Scale**: start at a minor note and all `WHWWHWW` steps are "on scale". DAW trick is to mark all whites from A and shift to any other note whose minor scale we want.

Ex - we can have A# minor, C major, etc.

## Chord
Notes played simultaneously, commonly 3 or 4 at a time.

Usually, chords are played by skipping one note in the scale (**135 Rule**).

Interesting observations can be drawn when we draw all possible chords for a scale.

Figure above shows all chords for C Major scale (135). Observations:
- start note of the chord is called **root note**
- chords can be **major**, **minor**, or **diminished**. This **quality** of a chord can be judged by its **interval**
- there are 3 Major chords, 3 minor chord, and 1 diminished chord
- major chords have 1 major third interval (3 whole tone gap) and minor have 1 minor third interval (2 whole tone gap; can be said perfect fifth too), diminished chord has 2 minor thirds
- 7th chord is diminished with major scale. If we do the same for a minor scale, it will always have 2nd schord diminished

A scale has limited chords that we can play around with. Ex - C minor chord is impossible in C major scale since a gap of 2 after C in C major scale is impossible.

### Other Chords

**Inversions**: take root note one octave up (**1st inversion**), following that bottom most note one octave up (**2nd inversion**).

At first glance, the second chord may look like E minor, but its actually C major 1st inversion chord.

**Suspended**: violates the rule of 2 gap and 3 gap (i.e. the major or minor third) and play notes at other available positions (i.e. perfect fourth or a major second).
