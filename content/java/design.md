## GoF Design Patterns
**Design Patterns**: guidelines providing solutions to recurring problems and good practices in software.

Design patterns are often called **GoF** (Gang of Four) design patterns because of [the book](https://g.co/kgs/RzdfZ2) that first outlined these design patterns 20 years ago, named so because of its 4 authors. 

3 types of Design Patterns:
1. **Creational** (_how to create objects or a group of related objects_)
2. **Structural** (_how objects use each other, their composition_)
3. **Behavioral** (_assignment of responsibilities between the objects_)
