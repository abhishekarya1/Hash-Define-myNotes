## Shell Scripting
- **#!** (sha-bang) (tells that the file is to be executed by /bin/sh)
- **Spaces between operands and operators are not at all valid (mostly) in a shell script.**
- **Comments**	
	- **#** (single line comment)
	- **/\*    \*/** (multi-line comment)
- **echo** ("" or '', but not ``)
    - `$ echo *` (equivalent to `ls`)
    - `$ echo "a" "b" "c"` ...
    - `$ echo "Hello" World`
    - `$ echo "hello \t world"`
    - `$ echo 'hello \t world'`
    - `$ echo Hello * World`
    - `$ echo "Hello   "World""` (no spaces in param means only one param)
    -  `echo -e "my \n world"` (recognizes escape sequences inside string)
    
- **Variables** - Shell, Environment, and Local (CASE SENSITIVE JUST LIKE REST OF UNIX)
    - ```sh
        #!/bin/sh
        echo $MY_NAME    #nothing printed, by default -> empty var
        echo What is your name? 
        read MY_NAME                #assign
        echo "Hello $MY_NAME - hope you're well."   #usage
        echo $MY_NAME
      ```
      - ($VAR_NAME : $ is required only when using the variable)
      - (`readonly` _var_name_ : makes a variable constant)
      - (`unset` _var_name_ : resets var value to empty)
- A _fresh_ shell console is started when we run a script, no var values are stored by default in between script runs.
- **export** $MY_VAR = abhi, and then run the script
- To channel back changes in variables to env, use dot `$ . ./script.sh`
- `touch "${USER_NAME}_file"` ({} specify variable placeholder and "" avoid var name extent)
- **Wildcards** (`*` `?` etc are allowed
- **Special Chars** (`"`, `'`, `\`, `(backtick)`, `$`) (Escape them as and when applicable)
---

### Command-Line Arguments
- **$0** (script name)
- **$X** (X is any number from 1...)
- **$#** (number of cmd line args the scipt is called with)
- **$$** (current PID)
- **$\*** (wrap all args in double-quotes)
- **$@** (wrap individual args in double-quotes)
- **$?** (exit status of prev command, 0 = success, 1 = failure)

---
### Quoting 
- **Double-quotes** (allows some special chars inside, like `$`, but not `\escape_seqs`)
- **Single-quotes** (ignores all special char inside)
- **Backticks** (anything inside of it is executed)

---
### Arrays
- `myArray=(one, two, three, four)...` (Definition)
- `myArray[3]=nine` (write single element)
- `echo ${myArray[3]}` (print single element)
- `echo ${myArray[*]}` or `echo ${myArray[@]}` (print all elements)
- `echo ${#array[*]}` (print number of elements in array) (can also use `@`)
<br>
- (curly braces {} are mandatory)
- (indexing starts from 0)
---
### Operators
- `$((2+3))`(no space issues)
- \`expr 2 + 3\` (spaces matters a lot here) (prints -> 2+3, if no space)

### Decision Making

- **if-then-elif-else-fi**
```sh
if [ ... ]
then
	#body
fi
```

```sh
if [ ... ]; then	#if and then needs to be on different lines or use ";"
elif
then
fi
```

```sh
#!/bin/sh 

FRUIT="kiwi"  

case  "$FRUIT"  in  
"apple")	echo "Apple pie is quite tasty."  
;;  
"banana")	echo "I like banana nut bread."  
;;  
"kiwi")		echo "New Zealand is famous for kiwi."  
;; 
*)			echo "Default Case."
;; 
esac
```
---
### Loops
- **for**
    ```sh
    #!/bin/sh
    for i in 1 2 * 4 5
    do
        echo "Loop is on : $i"
    done
    ```
    (* loops on every file name too in the current dir)

- **while**
    ```sh
    while [#condition]
    do
    done
    ```
    
    ```sh
    while :  #always true
    do
    done
    ```
 - **until**
	```sh
	 until [#condition]
	 do
	 done
	```
- **select** (not in sh, but in bash)
- **Loop Controls**
	- **break** {n}
	- **continue** {n} 
---
### Substitution
- Command Substitution (`` or `$()`)
	```sh
	#!/bin/sh
	DATE=`date`		#date is executed and result stored in variable
	echo "Current Date: $DATE"  
	# Output-> Current Date: 07 Nov 2020 00:09:01
	```
--- 
###  Functions
- **Syntax**
```sh
#definition

foo(){
#body
}

foo 	#function call
```	
- **Parameterized Function**
 ```sh
 foo(){
 echo "$1 $2 is the best!"
 #parameters can be accessed using $1, $2 and so on inside the funtion
return 10
 }

foo abhi arya		#function call
echo "$?"		#capture value returnd by last command
 ```
