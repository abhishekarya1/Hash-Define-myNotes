```txt
$ grep 'regex' [file1] ...

$ grep abcd test.txt
-i 		case insensitive match
-c		print only count of matching lines
-n		print matched line with number
-l		print only the names of files with matching lines
-v		print all lines that DO NOT match the pattern

-r "pattern" * recursive search
-w "is" 	   check for full words (can't match his, this, tiss now)
-B 'regex'     regex is Basic, a+ (default)
-E* 'regex'    regex is extended, (this|that|those)
```

Use `ls | grep 'regex'` to search for directory/file names and print them.
