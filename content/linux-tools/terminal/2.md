## System 

`uname -a` (lists all info about the system like OS, CPU arch, etc...)
```txt
$ uname -a
Linux fedora 5.14.0-60.fc35.aarch64 #1 SMP Mon Aug 30 16:30:42 UTC 2021 aarch64 aarch64 aarch64 GNU/Linux
```

`date` (Mon Sep 26 18:59:15 IST 2022)

`cal` (prints the calendar of current month highlighting the current date)

```txt
$ cal -y		print cal for full current year
$ cal -3		print cal for prev, current, and next month
```

`whoami` (prints current user's username)

`ps` (disaply all running processes)

`whereis <command>` (lists all command executables for a command on the system)

`which <command>` (shows path to the specified command's _default_ executable)

`whatis <command>` (shows a small description of specified command from man pages) 

```txt
$ whereis ls
ls: /usr/bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz

$ which ls
ls: /usr/bin/ls

$ whatis ls
ls (1) - lists directory contents
```

## Meta

`env` (show environment valriable; shows all if no parameter is supplied)

```txt
$ env $HOME

$ TEST=foo 		creating a env variable (only for current shell) (session-bound lifetime)
$ echo $TEST	prints "foo"
```

`export TEST=foobar` (create an env variable and we can use it in _all_ the currently runnning programs/shell) (session-bound lifetime)

`alias` `unalias` (set alias for commonly used commands; erased after terminal restart (session-bound lifetime)

```txt
$ alias GOFOO="cd /a/b/c/foo"

$ unalias FOO
```

`logout` `exit`

`clear` (clears terminal)

`history <n>` (list last _n_ used commands)

{{% notice tip%}}
Run last used command with `!!`, run command number 69 with `!69` (command number can be found with `history` command)
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
**reverse-i-search** (_Ctrl_+_R_) : Hit Ctrl+R to go one step back in the search results; forward control varies by system. Use Ctrl+O to run command the command found in the reverse search.
{{% /notice %}}

### Help

`man <command>` (opens man[^1] page of the command; often as _less_ pager)
 
`help <command>`

`command --help`	

[^1]: Several vendors document man pages, like https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages or https://linux.die.net/man

## Control
**Redirection**: read from/write to files other than `/dev/stdin` or `/dev/stdout`

- **Input redirection** (`<`): read from a specified file instead of `stdin`
- **Output redirection** (`>`): write to a specified file insted of `stdout` 

```txt
$ echo "Hello" > file.txt

$ echo "World" > file.txt		(> will overwrite everything in file)

$ echo "World" >> file.txt		(>> appends to file) 


$ cat < foo.txt > bar.txt 		(data goes from "foo" to cat command and then to "bar")

								(LR associative since leftmost must be a command and it needs parameters to run)
```

**Piping**: use `|` to channel the output of one command as the input to another command

```txt
$ ls | less			output of ls becomes input of less command

$ ls | file.txt		won't work since we are trying to channel to a file
					(piping differs from redirection in this way)
```

**Tee-ing**: pipe to `tee` command and we can write to `stdout` (_implicit_) as well as another file that we specify (_explicit_)
```txt
$ ls | tee file.txt
```
